1.  There is bug with message send button, 
    it gains colors even when you have typeed empty space or shift

2.  when you focus on input and click enter, text must be send (instead of shifting down)

3.  when text reaches 3rd line it reducing, but then popping up again on 2nd line
    so, it is getting biggeer again
